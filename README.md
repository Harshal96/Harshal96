# Hi, I'm Harshal 

I design APIs and Systems for 6sense, previously for Visa, I sometimes work on UI & perform UXR creating continuous interactions between the digital and physical reality. 

Read more about me, my previous work/projects, my blog on my portfolio: https://harshal.one

- **2014**: started web development only using HTML/CSS/JS 
- **2017**: launched an integrated agency and deployed over 50 websites by 2017 learning more technologies and developing a keen sense for UI
- **2018**: got bachelors from Mumbai University and started masters at Carnegie Mellon University
- **2019**: wrote low-overhead backend code in Vert.x (or Scala, FastAPI, Go) and deployed fault-tolerant docker images into multiple kubernetes pods
- **2020**: designed APIs using OpenAPI/Swagger
- **2021**: combined all of the above as I lead the development of *Athena at Visa* and *Paradise IoT Dashboard at Digiotouch*

> I focus my design and development around stories. Stories of what it has been, what it is, and what it can be. Stories that have a faint scent of recognition – an inviting solace – however are bound with a wild appeal, a reinvention of convention, and a hypothesis of probability.

> It is with this interest I approach research, procedure, and plan as mediums for examining, inciting, and encouraging the poetics of interactions. My work is grounded in the interplay of humans, nature, and innovation; a lifelong exploration of what it means to be human, and how we can better connect with each other.
